## Key Features

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Multi-Week Program Management" icon="calendar-days">
    Rippler includes a complete 12-week periodized training program with 4 training days per week. The program follows a tier-based structure:
    
    - **T1 exercises**: Main compound lifts (Bench, Squat, OHP, Deadlift)
    - **T2 exercises**: Variation work at higher volume
    - **T3 exercises**: Accessory work taken to maximum reps
    
    Each week follows specific set/rep schemes with automatic weight calculations based on your training maxes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Smart Weight Calculations" icon="calculator">
    The app automatically calculates target weights for each exercise based on:
    
    - Your 1RM goals stored in AsyncStorage
    - Week-specific percentages (e.g., Week 1: 85%, Week 2: 90%)
    - Exercise-specific modifiers for variations
    - Manual overrides when you need to adjust targets
    
    All calculations happen in real-time, so updating your goals instantly updates all future workouts.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Detailed Workout Logging" icon="list-check">
    Track every set with precision:
    
    - Weight lifted (supports lbs, kg, or bodyweight)
    - Reps completed (including "to failure" sets)
    - Checkbox completion with haptic feedback
    - Expandable exercise cards for clean UI
    - Progress bars showing overall workout completion
    
    All data persists locally using React Native AsyncStorage.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="History & Progress Tracking" icon="chart-simple">
    View your complete training history:
    
    - Calendar view showing completed workouts
    - Week-by-week progression
    - Exercise history with weight/rep trends
    - Goal tracking for 1RM improvements
    
    The history screen uses React Query for efficient data loading and caching.
  </Accordion>
