## Overview

The workout types define the core data structures for managing training programs, tracking daily workouts, and overriding default targets in the Rippler app.

## WorkoutDay

Represents a planned workout day with target exercises.

```typescript
export interface WorkoutDay {
  week: number;
  day: string;
  dateSerial: number;
  exercises: TargetExercise[];
}
```

<ParamField path="week" type="number" required>
  The week number in the training program (e.g., 1, 2, 3...)
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="day" type="string" required>
  The day identifier (e.g., "Monday", "Day 1", "A")
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="dateSerial" type="number" required>
  A serialized date value used for scheduling and sorting workouts chronologically
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="exercises" type="TargetExercise[]" required>
  Array of exercises planned for this workout day. See [TargetExercise](/api/types/exercise#targetexercise) for details.
</ParamField>

### Usage

WorkoutDay is used to structure planned training sessions within a program. Each day contains multiple exercises with prescribed sets, reps, and weights.

## LoggedWorkout

Represents a completed workout session with actual performance data.

```typescript
export interface LoggedWorkout {
  id: string;
  week: number;
  day: string;
  dateLogged: string;
  exercises: LoggedExercise[];
  completed: boolean;
}
```

<ParamField path="id" type="string" required>
  Unique identifier for the logged workout session
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="week" type="number" required>
  The week number this workout belongs to in the training program
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="day" type="string" required>
  The day identifier matching the planned WorkoutDay
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="dateLogged" type="string" required>
  ISO date string when the workout was completed (e.g., "2026-02-28")
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="exercises" type="LoggedExercise[]" required>
  Array of exercises that were performed. See [LoggedExercise](/api/types/exercise#loggedexercise) for details.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="completed" type="boolean" required>
  Whether the entire workout session was completed
</ParamField>

### Usage

LoggedWorkout tracks actual training sessions, allowing users to review their performance history and track progress over time.

<Note>
The `completed` flag can be used to distinguish between partial workouts (incomplete) and fully finished sessions.
</Note>

## WorkoutProgram

Represents a complete training program with multiple weeks of planned workouts.

```typescript
export interface WorkoutProgram {
  exercises: string[];
  weeks: Record<string, WorkoutDay[]>;
}
```

<ParamField path="exercises" type="string[]" required>
  Complete list of all unique exercises included in the program
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="weeks" type="Record<string, WorkoutDay[]>" required>
  Dictionary mapping week identifiers (e.g., "1", "2", "3") to arrays of WorkoutDay objects for that week
</ParamField>

### Usage

WorkoutProgram structures an entire training cycle, typically spanning multiple weeks. The `exercises` array provides a master list of all movements in the program, while `weeks` organizes the daily workouts chronologically.

<Tip>
The exercises array is useful for displaying a program overview or filtering/searching exercises across the entire program.
</Tip>

## TargetOverride

Allows customization of prescribed targets for specific exercises in the program.

```typescript
export interface TargetOverride {
  week: number;
  day: string;
  exerciseIndex: number;
  weight?: number | string;
  reps?: number | string;
  sets?: number | string;
}
```

<ParamField path="week" type="number" required>
  The week number where the override applies
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="day" type="string" required>
  The day identifier where the override applies
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="exerciseIndex" type="number" required>
  Zero-based index of the exercise within the WorkoutDay.exercises array
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="weight" type="number | string">
  Override for the target weight. Can be numeric or string (e.g., "BW" for bodyweight)
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="reps" type="number | string">
  Override for the target reps. Can be numeric or string (e.g., "AMRAP")
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="sets" type="number | string">
  Override for the target sets. Can be numeric or string for special protocols
</ParamField>

### Usage

TargetOverride enables users to adjust program prescriptions without modifying the base program. This is useful for:

- Adjusting weights based on individual strength levels
- Modifying rep schemes for injury management
- Personalizing programs while maintaining the original template

<Warning>
All override fields are optional. Only provide the fields you want to override; other fields will use the default values from TargetExercise.
</Warning>
