## Get Started in 5 Minutes

This guide will get you from zero to running the Rippler app on your phone or simulator as quickly as possible. For a more detailed setup, see the [Installation guide](/installation).

<Note>
  **Prerequisites**: You need Node.js 18+ and npm installed. Check with `node --version` and `npm --version`.
</Note>

## Quick Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone and Install">
    Clone the repository and install dependencies:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd rippler
    npm install
    ```

    This will install all required packages including Expo, React Native, and dependencies.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Up Environment Variables">
    Create a `.env` file in the project root:

    ```bash .env
    DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/rippler"
    REPLIT_DEV_DOMAIN="your-domain.replit.dev"  # Optional, for Replit deployments
    ```

    <Warning>
      If you don't have PostgreSQL running locally, you can skip database setup for now. The app will still work with AsyncStorage for workout logging.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start the Development Server">
    Run the Expo development server:

    ```bash
    npm run expo:dev
    ```

    This starts the Expo dev server with proper environment variables configured for React Native.

    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash Output
    › Metro waiting on exp://192.168.1.100:8081
    › Scan the QR code above with Expo Go (Android) or the Camera app (iOS)
    
    › Press a │ open Android
    › Press i │ open iOS simulator
    › Press w │ open web
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Open on Your Device">
    Choose how you want to run the app:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Physical Device">

        </Warning>
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Explore the App">
    You should now see the Rippler home screen with the 12-week program!

    Try these actions:
    - Navigate to **Program** tab to see all 12 weeks
    - Tap any workout day to start logging
    - Open **Goals** tab to set your 1RM targets
    - Check **History** to see completed workouts
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding the App Structure

Once the app is running, here's what you'll see:

<Accordion title="Program Tab (Main Screen)">
  The Program tab shows your current week with all scheduled training days:

  ```tsx client/navigation/MainTabNavigator.tsx
  <Tab.Screen
    name="ProgramTab"
    component={ProgramStackNavigator}
    options={{
      title: "Program",
      tabBarIcon: ({ color, size }) => (
        <Feather name="calendar" size={size} color={color} />
      ),
    }}
  />
  ```

  - **Week selector** at the top (swipe or tap arrows)
  - **4 workout cards** per week (Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, Sunday)
  - Tap any card to open the workout and start logging
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Workout Screen">
  The workout screen is where the magic happens:

  ```tsx client/screens/WorkoutScreen.tsx
  // Initialize workout with targets from program
  const initializeLoggedWorkout = useCallback((): LoggedWorkout => {
    return {
      id: `${week}-${day}`,
      week,
      day,
      dateLogged: new Date().toISOString(),
      exercises: targetWorkout.exercises.map((ex, index) => {
        const effective = getEffectiveTarget(ex, index);
        const totalSets = typeof effective.sets === "number"
          ? effective.sets
          : parseInt(String(effective.sets).replace("+", ""), 10);

        return {
          tier: ex.tier,
          exercise: ex.exercise,
          sets: Array.from({ length: totalSets }, (_, i) => ({
            setNumber: i + 1,
            weight: "",
            reps: "",
            completed: false,
          })),
        };
      }),
      completed: false,
    };
  }, [week, day, targetWorkout, getEffectiveTarget]);
  ```

  Features:
  - **Expandable exercise cards** with tier badges (T1, T2, T3)
  - **Target weights/reps** calculated from your 1RM goals
  - **Set-by-set logging** with weight and rep inputs
  - **Progress bar** showing overall completion
  - **Edit button** to modify targets on the fly
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Goals Tab">
  Set your training maxes for automatic weight calculations:

  - Enter 1RM for Bench, Squat, Deadlift, OHP
  - Weights automatically calculate for all exercises
  - Changes apply to all future workouts
  - Goals persist locally in AsyncStorage
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="History Tab">
  View your complete training history:

  - Calendar view with completed workout indicators
  - Week-by-week progression
  - Tap any past workout to review sets/reps
</Accordion>

## Development Workflow

### Hot Reloading

The app supports fast refresh. Make changes to any component and see them instantly:

```tsx client/components/Button.tsx
export function Button({ children, onPress, variant = "primary" }) {
  return (
    <Pressable
      onPress={onPress}
      style={({ pressed }) => [
        styles.button,
        variant === "primary" ? styles.primary : styles.secondary,
        pressed && styles.pressed,
      ]}
    >
      <ThemedText style={styles.buttonText}>{children}</ThemedText>
    </Pressable>
  );
}
```

Change the button style and it updates immediately on your device.

### Testing on Multiple Platforms

Rippler runs on iOS, Android, and web from the same codebase:

<CodeGroup>
```bash iOS Simulator
npm run expo:dev
# Then press 'i' in terminal
```

```bash Android Emulator
npm run expo:dev
# Then press 'a' in terminal
```

```bash Web Browser
npm run expo:dev
# Then press 'w' in terminal
```
</CodeGroup>

### TypeScript Support

The app is fully typed with TypeScript. Hover over any component for type information:

```tsx client/types/workout.ts
export interface WorkoutDay {
  week: number;
  day: string;
  dateSerial: number;
  exercises: TargetExercise[];
}

export interface TargetExercise {
  tier: string;
  exercise: string;
  weight: number | string;
  reps: number | string;
  sets: number | string;
}

export interface LoggedSet {
  setNumber: number;
  weight: string;
  reps: string;
  completed: boolean;
}
```

## Running the Backend (Optional)

If you want to test the full stack with database persistence:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start PostgreSQL">
    Make sure PostgreSQL is running and create the database:

    ```bash
    createdb rippler
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run Migrations">
    Push the database schema:

    ```bash
    npm run db:push
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start the Server">
    Run the Express server in development mode:

    ```bash
    npm run server:dev
    ```

    The server starts on port 5000 by default.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Module not found: @/components/..." icon="triangle-exclamation">
    This is a path alias issue. Make sure your `babel.config.js` is correct:

    ```js babel.config.js
    module.exports = function (api) {
      api.cache(true);
      return {
        presets: ["babel-preset-expo"],
        plugins: [
          [
            "module-resolver",
            {
              root: ["./"],
              alias: {
                "@": "./client",
                "@shared": "./shared",
              },
            },
          ],
          "react-native-reanimated/plugin",
        ],
      };
    };
    ```

    Then restart the dev server with `npm run expo:dev`.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Expo Go not connecting" icon="mobile-screen">
    Make sure your phone and computer are on the same WiFi network.

    If that doesn't work, try:
    ```bash
    npx expo start --tunnel
    ```

    This uses a cloud tunnel to connect.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Database connection error" icon="database">
    If you see database errors, check your `.env` file:

    ```bash
    # Make sure DATABASE_URL is correct
    DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/rippler"
    ```

    Or skip the database entirely - the app works with AsyncStorage only.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Android emulator not opening" icon="android">
    Make sure you have Android Studio installed and an emulator configured.

    List available emulators:
    ```bash
    emulator -list-avds
    ```

    Create one if needed through Android Studio > AVD Manager.
