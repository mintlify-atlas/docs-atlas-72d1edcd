## Overview

The Exercise Library lets you create and maintain a personal database of exercises beyond those in the Rippler program. Store custom movements, track variations, and add personal notes about form cues or preferences.

### Building a Movement Database

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="For Future Programs">

    - Deficit vs. standard vs. elevated variations

### Organizing by Category

Use naming conventions to group exercises:

| Category | Example Names |
|----------|---------------|
| **Squat Variations** | Back Squat, Front Squat, Bulgarian Split Squat |
| **Pressing** | Bench Press, Overhead Press, Incline Press |

Consistent naming helps you find exercises quickly, especially as your library grows to 50+ movements.

## Tips for Effective Note-Taking

### Concise and Actionable

Good notes are:
- **Brief**: 1-2 sentences maximum
- **Specific**: "Elbows at 45 degrees" not "keep good form"
- **Actionable**: Things you can immediately do during setup or execution
- **Personal**: Focus on what works for YOUR body and technique

### Examples

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Good note example">
    **Romanian Deadlift**
    
    Notes: "Hinge at hips first, bar stays close to shins, feel stretch in hamstrings. Stop at mid-shin before back rounds."
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Good note example">
    **Cable Face Pull**
    
    Notes: "High cable, split stance, pull to face level. Focus on rear delts, not arms. 15-20 rep range works best."
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Good note example">
    **Deficit Deadlift**
    
    Notes: "2-inch plates under feet, slows lockout. Good for building leg drive. Use straps for 5+ reps."
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
