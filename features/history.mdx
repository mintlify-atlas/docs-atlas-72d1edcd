## History Data Details

### What's Recorded

Each workout entry stores:

- **Week and day**: Program position
- **Date logged**: Timestamp of when you logged it
- **All exercises**: Every movement in the workout
- **Set details**: Weight, reps, and completion status for each set
- **Completion status**: Whether you marked the entire workout complete

### Data Accuracy

<Note>
History reflects exactly what you logged, even if you later change your goals. Past workouts don't update when goals change.
</Note>

This means:
- Historical accuracy is preserved
- You can see what you actually lifted, not recalculated targets
- Goal changes only affect future workouts, not logged sessions

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Review Regularly" icon="clock-rotate-left">
    Check your history weekly to stay aware of progress and consistency.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Don't Delete Partials" icon="hand">
    Partial workouts are valuable data. Keep them to understand your true training volume.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Update Immediately" icon="bolt">
    Make corrections right away if you notice errors in logged workouts.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Use for Motivation" icon="trophy">
    Seeing a growing list of completed workouts is powerful for staying consistent.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Tips for History Analysis

### Identifying Patterns

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Training frequency">
    Count workouts per week. Are you hitting your intended training frequency (3-4x/week for Rippler)?
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Time between sessions">
    Look at date gaps. Consistent 2-3 day spacing is ideal for recovery and adaptation.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Completion rates by week">
    Do you complete more workouts in early weeks vs. later high-intensity weeks? This is normal.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Set completion trends">
    Are you finishing 90%+ of sets? If consistently lower, consider adjusting goals or managing fatigue better.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Using History for PRs

Find your personal records:

1. Scroll through history looking for the same exercise
2. Note the highest weight × reps combination
3. Use this as a benchmark for future cycles
4. Celebrate when you beat old records

<Info>
While Rippler doesn't automatically track PRs, your history contains all the data. Review it periodically to recognize achievements.
</Info>
