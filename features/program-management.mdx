## Program Philosophy

The Rippler uses **wave periodization**:

- Intensity and volume fluctuate within and across weeks
- Some days are heavier, others focus on volume
- The 12-week cycle builds to peak strength
- Trust the process and follow the prescribed targets

<Note>
Resist the urge to add weight or reps beyond targets early in the program. The progression is carefully designed to peak your strength at the right time.
