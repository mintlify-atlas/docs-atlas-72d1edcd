## Overview

The workout tracking feature is the core of Rippler, allowing you to log every detail of your training sessions. Track weights, reps, and mark sets as complete while following your programmed targets.

## Starting a Workout

  <Step title="Navigate to a workout day">
    From the Program screen, select any workout day (e.g., Week 1 - Day 1) to begin tracking.

## Logging Sets

### Recording Your Performance

For each set, you'll enter:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Weight Used" icon="dumbbell">
    Enter the actual weight lifted (in lbs) or use "BW" for bodyweight exercises
  </Card>
  <Card title="Reps Completed" icon="hashtag">
    Record how many reps you completed for the set
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Marking Sets Complete

Once you've logged the weight and reps:

1. Tap the checkmark or complete button for the set
2. The set will be marked as complete with visual feedback
3. The progress indicator updates to reflect completed sets

## Target Weights & Modifications

### Automatic Target Calculation

Targets are automatically calculated based on:
- Your goal weights (set in Goals screen)
- Current week and day in the program
- Exercise tier and percentage prescriptions

### Modifying Targets

<Steps>
  <Step title="Tap the target info">
    Tap on the target information row (showing weight × reps × sets) for any exercise.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Edit values">
    A modal appears where you can modify:
    - Weight (enter number or "BW" for bodyweight)
    - Reps (enter number or "Max" for max effort sets)
    - Sets (number of sets to complete)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save changes">
    Tap Save to apply your modifications. Modified exercises show an "Modified" label.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Target modifications only apply to the specific week and day you're editing. They won't affect other workouts in your program.
</Warning>

## Progress Tracking

### Overall Progress Bar

At the top of each workout, you'll see:

- A visual progress bar showing completion percentage
- "X / Y sets completed" counter
- Updates in real-time as you complete sets

### Per-Exercise Progress

Each exercise card displays:
- Completed sets vs. total sets (e.g., "3/5")
- Color-coded indicator: green when all sets are complete
- Expandable set list showing individual set progress

## Completing a Workout

  <Tab title="Manual Completion">
    Once you've finished your workout:
    
    1. Tap the "Complete Workout" button at the bottom

    3. Success haptic feedback confirms completion (on mobile)
    4. You'll return to the Program screen
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Auto Completion">
    The workout is automatically marked complete when:
    
    - All sets for all exercises are checked off

## Tips for Effective Tracking

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Log sets immediately">
    Enter your weight and reps right after completing each set for the most accurate tracking. The app autosaves all changes.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use the target as a guide">
    Target weights are calculated to progress you safely. If a target feels too heavy or light, modify it rather than skipping it.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Track partial workouts">
    Even if you can't complete a full workout, log what you did. Progress is saved automatically and you can return to finish later.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Review before leaving">
    Check the overall progress bar before completing to ensure all sets are logged correctly.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Common Scenarios

### Bodyweight Exercises

For exercises like pull-ups:
- Target weight shows as "BW" (bodyweight)
- You can still log additional weight if using a weight belt
- Or simply enter "BW" in the weight field

### Max Effort Sets

When your target shows "Max" reps:
- Perform as many reps as possible (AMRAP)
- Log the actual number of reps you completed
- This data helps track strength progress over time

### Adjusting Mid-Workout

If you need to change weight between sets:
1. Each set has its own weight input field
2. Enter the new weight used for that specific set
3. The target weight is just a guide—actual performance matters most
