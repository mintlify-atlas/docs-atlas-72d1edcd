title: "Goal Setting"
description: "Set your training maxes and goals to automatically calculate workout targets throughout the program"
---

## Overview

Goal setting is the foundation of your Rippler program. By entering your current or goal 1RM (one-rep max) for key lifts, the app automatically calculates appropriate training weights for all 12 weeks.

<Info>
All workout targets throughout the program are calculated as percentages of your goal weights. Accurate goals lead to effective training.
</Info>

## Accessing Goal Settings

Navigate to the **Goals** tab from the bottom navigation to view and edit your training maxes.

## Exercise Categories

Goals are organized into three tiers matching the Rippler program structure:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="T1 - Main Lifts">
    **1RM Goals** for the four primary compound movements:
    
    - Squat
    - Bench Press
    - Deadlift
    - Overhead Press (OHP)
    
    These are your competition lifts or primary strength goals.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="T2 - Secondary Lifts">
    **Training maxes** for supporting movements:
    
    - Front Squat
    - Close Grip Bench Press (CGBP)
    - Romanian Deadlift (RDL)
    - Incline Press
    
    These build volume and address weak points.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="T3 - Accessories">
    **Working weights** for isolation and accessory work:
    
    - Leg Press
    - Dumbbell variations
    - Other accessory movements
    - Pull-ups (bodyweight only)
    
    These add targeted volume for muscle growth.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Setting Your Goals

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enter your training maxes">
    For each exercise, tap the input field and enter your goal weight in pounds (lbs).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Use realistic numbers">
    Enter weights you can confidently lift for a single rep (1RM) or your training max (90-95% of true max).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save your changes">
    Tap the "Save Goals" button at the bottom. The button highlights when you have unsaved changes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Changing goals will recalculate all workout targets. If you're mid-program, consider whether updating goals makes sense for your current training cycle.
</Warning>

## Special Cases

### Bodyweight Exercises

Pull-ups are automatically set to bodyweight:
- The input field shows "BW" and is disabled
- No weight entry needed
- If you use additional weight, add it during workout tracking

### Starting Without Maxes

If you're new to training or unsure of your maxes:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Conservative Approach" icon="shield-halved">
    Start with weights you know you can handle for 3-5 reps, then estimate your 1RM using a calculator (multiply by ~1.15-1.20).
  </Card>
  <Card title="Test Week" icon="dumbbell">
    Dedicate a week to finding your true maxes before starting the program. This ensures accurate targets from day one.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Default Values

### Reset to Defaults

The "Reset Defaults" button restores the program's default goal weights:

1. Tap "Reset Defaults" at the bottom
2. All fields populate with preset values
3. Remember to tap "Save Goals" to apply the changes

<Note>
Default values are example weights. You should customize them based on your actual strength levels for optimal results.
</Note>

## How Goals Affect Training

### Automatic Calculation

Once saved, your goals determine:

- **Week-specific percentages**: T1 lifts might use 70% Week 1, 75% Week 2, etc.
- **Exercise variations**: Secondary lifts calculated as percentages of main lift goals
- **Progressive overload**: Weights increase systematically across the 12 weeks

### Viewing Calculated Targets

To see how your goals translate to workout weights:

1. Go to the Program tab
2. Select any workout day
3. View the "Target" row for each exercise
4. Targets update immediately when you change goals

<Info>
The Rippler uses wave periodization, so target weights will vary throughout each week and across the program.
</Info>

## Updating Goals Mid-Program

### When to Update

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="After testing new maxes">
    If you test and hit new PRs, update your goals to reflect your increased strength. Future weeks will use these new numbers.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="If targets feel wrong">
    Too heavy or light consistently? Adjust your goals up or down by 5-10% and reassess after a few workouts.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Between training cycles">
    The ideal time to update goals is between 12-week cycles when starting the program fresh.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### What Doesn't Change

<Warning>
Updating goals doesn't change already-logged workouts. Your history remains accurate to what you actually lifted.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Be Honest" icon="heart">
    Enter true maxes, not aspirational ones. The program builds you toward bigger lifts safely.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Consider Fatigue" icon="battery-half">
    Use a training max (90-95% of true max) rather than absolute maxes to allow for day-to-day variation.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Track Progress" icon="chart-line">
    Note your starting goals. After 12 weeks, test new maxes to measure improvement.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Adjust as Needed" icon="sliders">
    If targets consistently feel off, don't hesitate to adjust goals and continue training.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Example Goal Setting

For an intermediate lifter (male, ~180 lbs bodyweight):

| Exercise | Example Goal |
|----------|-------------|
| Squat | 315 lbs |
| Bench Press | 225 lbs |
| Deadlift | 405 lbs |
| Overhead Press | 135 lbs |
| Front Squat | 225 lbs |
| CGBP | 185 lbs |

<Note>
These are examples only. Your goals should reflect your actual strength level and training experience.
